# Shoters-game
It is a ready to play networking game, which works well at local network. There is lack of much things like menu, player nicks, etc. 
I only brought it to the state when you can play via network and nothing more. The idea of the game is simple. Just shoot to your opponents by LPM. 
With space you can set a wall close to you, which blocks bullets. Moving is by AWSD. Feel free to use this code.
